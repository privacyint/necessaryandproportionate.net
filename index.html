	International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance
</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Calibri'>Final version 10 May
2013</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Calibri'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Calibri'>As technologies that
facilitate State surveillance of communications advance, States are failing to
ensure that laws and regulations related to communications surveillance adhere
to international human rights and adequately protect the rights to privacy and
freedom of expression. This document attempts to explain how international human
rights law applies in the current digital environment, particularly in light of
the increase in and changes to communications surveillance technologies and
techniques. These principles can provide civil society groups, industry, and States
with a framework to evaluate whether current or proposed surveillance laws and
practices are consistent with human rights. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Calibri'>These principles are the
outcome of a global consultation with civil society groups, industry and
international experts in communications surveillance law, policy and technology.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-family:Calibri'>Preamble</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Calibri'>Privacy is a fundamental
human right, and is central to the maintenance of democratic societies. It is
essential to human dignity and it reinforces other rights, such as freedom of
expression and information, and freedom of association, and is recognised under
international human rights law.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Calibri'>[i]</span></span></span></a> Activities
that restrict the right to privacy, including communications surveillance, can
only be justified when they are prescribed by law, they are necessary to
achieve a legitimate aim, and are proportionate to the aim pursued.<a
href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:
Calibri'>[ii]</span></span></span></a></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Calibri'>Before public adoption of
the Internet, well-established legal principles and logistical burdens inherent
in monitoring communications created limits to State communications
surveillance. In recent decades, those logistical barriers to surveillance have
decreased and the application of legal principles in new technological contexts
has become unclear. The explosion of digital communications content and
information about communications, or "communications metadata," the falling
cost of storing and mining large sets of data, and the provision of personal
content through third party service providers make State surveillance possible
at an unprecedented scale.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Calibri'>[iii]</span></span></span></a> Meanwhile,
conceptualisations of existing human rights law have not kept up with the
modern and changing communications surveillance capabilities of the State, the
ability of the State to combine and organize information gained from different
surveillance techniques, or the increased sensitivity of the information
available to be accessed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Calibri'>Although access to
communications content must only occur in exceptional situations, the frequency
with which States are seeking access to communications metadata -- information
about an individual's communications or use of electronic devices -- is rising
dramatically, without adequate scrutiny.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Calibri'>[iv]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;When
accessed and analysed, communications metadata may create a profile of an
individual's private life, including medical conditions, political and
religious viewpoints, interactions and interests, disclosing as much detail as,
or even greater detail than would be discernible from the content of
communications alone.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Calibri'>[v]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;Despite
the vast potential for intrusion into an individual's private life, legislative
and policy instruments often afford communications metadata a lower level of
protection and do not place sufficient restrictions on how they can be
subsequently used by agencies, including how they are data-mined, shared, and
retained.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Calibri'>In order for States to
actually meet their international human rights obligations in relation to
communications surveillance, they must comply with the principles set out
below. These principles apply not only to the State's obligation to respect and
fulfil individuals' rights, but also to the obligation to protect individuals'
rights from abuse by non-State actors, including corporate entities.<a
href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:
Calibri'>[vi]</span></span></span></a> The private sector bears equal
responsibility for respecting and protecting human rights, particularly given
the key role it plays in designing, developing and disseminating technologies;
enabling and providing communications; and &#8211; where required &#8211;
cooperating with State surveillance activities. Nevertheless, the scope of the
present Principles is limited to the obligations of the State. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Calibri'>Changing technology and
definitions</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Calibri'>"Communications
surveillance" in the modern environment encompasses the monitoring,
interception, collection, preservation and retention of, interference with, or
access to information </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Calibri'>that
includes, reflects, arises from or is about a person's communications in the
past, present or future. "Communications" include activities, interactions and
transactions transmitted through electronic mediums, such as content of
communications, the identity of the parties to the communications,
location-tracking information such as IP addresses, the time and duration of
communications, and identifiers of communication equipment used in
communications.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Calibri'>Traditionally,
the invasiveness of communications surveillance </span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Calibri'>has been evaluated on the basis of artificial and
formalistic categories. Existing legal frameworks distinguish between </span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Calibri'>"content" or "non-content," "subscriber
information" or "metadata," stored data or in transit data, data held in the
home or in </span><span style='font-family:Calibri'>the<span lang=EN-US>
possession of a third party service provider.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7"
title=""><span style='font-family:Calibri'>[vii]</span></a>
</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Calibri'>However</span><span
style='font-family:Calibri'>, these distinctions are no longer appropriate for
measuring the degree of the intrusion that communications surveillance makes
into individuals' private lives. While it has long been agreed that
communications content deserves significant protection in law because of its
capability to reveal sensitive information, it is now clear that other
information arising from communications &#8211; metadata and other forms of
non-content data &#8211; may reveal even more about an individual than the
content itself, and thus deserves equivalent protection. </span><span
style='font-family:Calibri'>Today, <span lang=EN-US>each of these types of
information might, taken alone or analysed </span></span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Calibri'>collectively, reveal a person's identity,
behaviour, associations, physical or medical conditions<b>, </b></span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Calibri'>race, color, sexual orientation,
national origins, or </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Calibri'>viewpoints;
or enable the mapping of the person's location, movements or interactions over
time</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Calibri'>,<a href="#_edn8"
name="_ednref8" title=""><span style='font-family:
Calibri'>[viii]</span></a> or of all people in a given location,
including around a public demonstration or other political event.<a
name="OLE_LINK4"><a name="OLE_LINK3"> </a></a></span><span style='font-family:
Calibri'>As a result, all </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Calibri'>information
that includes, reflects, arises from or is about a person's communications and
that is not readily available and easily accessible to the general<b> </b>public,
should be considered to be "protected information", and should accordingly be
given the highest protection in law.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Calibri'>In evaluating
the invasiveness of State communications surveillance, it is necessary to
consider both the potential of the surveillance to reveal protected
information, as well as the purpose for which the information is sought by the
State. Communications surveillance that will lead to the revelation of
protected information that may place a person at risk of investigation,
discrimination or violation of human rights will constitute a serious
infringement on an individual's right to privacy, and will</span><span
style='font-family:Calibri'> also undermine the enjoyment of other fundamental
rights, including the right to free expression, association, and political
participation.&nbsp; This is because these rights require people to be able to
communicate free from the chilling effect of government surveillance. A determination
of both the character and potential uses of the information sought will thus be
necessary in each specific case.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Calibri'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Calibri'>When adopting a
new communications surveillance technique or expanding the scope of an existing
technique, the State should ascertain whether the information likely to be
procured falls within the ambit of "protected information" before seeking it,
and should submit to the scrutiny of the judiciary or other democratic
oversight mechanism. </span><span style='font-family:Calibri'>In considering
whether information obtained through communications surveillance rises to the
level of "protected information", the form as well as the scope and duration of
the surveillance are relevant factors. B</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Calibri'>ecause pervasive or systematic monitoring has the
capacity to reveal private information far in excess of its constituent parts,
it can elevate surveillance of non-protected information to a level of
invasiveness that demands strong protection.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Calibri'>[ix]</span></span></span></a></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Calibri'>The determination of
whether the State may conduct communications surveillance that interferes with
protected information must be consistent with the following principles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-family:Calibri'>The Principles</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Calibri'>Legality</span></b><span
style='font-family:Calibri'>: Any limitation to the right to privacy must be
prescribed by law. The State must not adopt or implement a measure that
interferes with the right to privacy in the absence of an existing publicly
available legislative act, which meets a standard of clarity and precision that
is sufficient to ensure that individuals have advance notice of and can foresee
its application. Given the rate of technological changes, laws that limit the
right to privacy should be subject to periodic review by means of a
participatory legislative or regulatory process. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Calibri'>Legitimate Aim</span></b><span
style='font-family:Calibri'>: </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Calibri'>Laws
should only permit communications surveillance by specified State authorities
to achieve a legitimate aim that it corresponds to a predominantly important
legal interest that is necessary in a democratic society.</span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Calibri'> Any measure must not be applied in a
manner which discriminates on the basis of </span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Calibri'>race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or
other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.</span></p>

<p class=normal style=';
line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-family:Calibri;
color:windowtext'>Necessity</span></b><span style='font-family:
Calibri;color:windowtext'>: </span><span lang=EN-US style='
font-family:Calibri;color:windowtext'>Laws permitting communications
surveillance by the State must limit surveillance to that which is strictly and
demonstrably necessary to achieve a legitimate aim. Communications surveillance
must only be conducted when it is the only means of achieving a legitimate aim,
or, when there are multiple means, it is the means least likely to infringe
upon human rights. The onus of establishing this justification, in judicial as
well as in legislative processes, is on the State.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Calibri'>Adequacy</span></b><span
style='font-family:Calibri'>: Any instance of communications surveillance
authorised by law must be appropriate to fulfil the specific legitimate aim
identified.</span></p>

<p class=normal style=';
line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-family:Calibri;
color:windowtext'>Proportionality</span></b><span style='
font-family:Calibri;color:windowtext'>: Communications surveillance should be
regarded as a highly intrusive act that interferes with the rights to privacy
and freedom of opinion and expression, threatening the foundations of a
democratic society. Decisions about communications surveillance must be made by
weighing the benefit sought to be achieved against the harm that would be
caused to the individual's rights and to other competing interests, and should
involve a consideration of the sensitivity of the information and the severity
of the infringement on the right to privacy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Calibri'>Specifically, this
requires that, if a State seeks access to protected information through
communications surveillance in the context of a criminal investigation, it must
establish to the competent, independent, and impartial judicial authority that:</span></p>

be (1) separate from the authorities conducting communications surveillance,
(2) conversant in issues related to and competent to make judicial decisions
about communications technologies and human rights, and (3) have adequate
resources in exercising the functions assigned to them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Calibri'>Due process</span></b><span
style='font-family:Calibri'>: Due process requires that States respect and
guarantee individuals' human rights by ensuring that lawful procedures that
govern any interference with human rights are properly enumerated in law,
consistently practiced, and available to the general public. </span><span

sufficient to justify retroactive authorisation.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Calibri'>User notification</span></b><span
style='font-family:Calibri'>: Individuals should be notified of a decision
authorising communications surveillance with enough time and information to

</span></span><span style='font-family:Calibri'>The individual affected is
notified as soon as the risk is lifted or within a reasonably practicable time
period, whichever is sooner, and in any event by the time the communications
surveillance has been completed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Calibri'>Upon the expiry of the
delay, communications service providers shall be free to notify individuals of
the communications surveillance, voluntarily or upon request.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Calibri'>Transparency: </span></b><span
style='font-family:Calibri'>States should be transparent about the use and scope
of communications surveillance techniques and powers. They should publish, at a
minimum, aggregate information on the number of requests approved and rejected,
a disaggregation of the requests by service provider and by investigation and
purpose. States should provide individuals with sufficient information to
enable them to fully comprehend the scope, nature and application of the laws
permitting communications surveillance. States should enable service providers
to publish the procedures they apply when dealing with State communications
surveillance, adhere to those procedures, and publish records of State
communications surveillance. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Calibri'>Public oversight</span></b><span
style='font-family:Calibri'>: States should establish independent oversight
mechanisms to ensure transparency and accountability of communications
surveillance.<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Calibri'>[xi]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;Oversight
mechanisms should have the authority to access information about State actions,
including, where appropriate, access to secret or classified information; to
assess whether the State is making legitimate use of its lawful capabilities;
to evaluate whether the State has been transparently and accurately publishing
information about the use and scope of communications surveillance techniques
and powers; and to publish periodic reports and other information relevant to
communications surveillance. Independent oversight mechanisms should be
established in addition to any oversight already provided through another
branch of government. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Calibri'>Integrity of
communications and systems</span></b><span style='font-family:Calibri'>: In
order to ensure the integrity, security and privacy of communications systems,
and in recognition of the fact that compromising security for State purposes
almost always compromises security more generally, States should not compel
service providers </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Calibri'>or
hardware or software vendors </span><span style='font-family:Calibri'>to build
surveillance or monitoring capability into their systems, or to collect or
retain particular information purely for State surveillance purposes. <i>A<span>
priori</span></i>&nbsp;data retention or collection should never be required of
service providers. Individuals have the right to express themselves
anonymously; States should therefore refrain from compelling the identification
of users as a precondition for service provision.<a href="#_edn12"
name="_ednref12" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:
Calibri'>[xii]</span></span></span></a></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Calibri'>Safeguards for
international cooperation</span></b><span style='font-family:Calibri'>: In
response to changes in the flows of information, and in communications technologies
and services, States may need to seek assistance from a foreign service
provider. Accordingly, the mutual legal assistance treaties (MLATs) and other
agreements entered into by States should ensure that, where the laws of more
than one state could apply to communications surveillance, the available
standard with the higher level of protection for individuals is applied. Where
States seek assistance for law enforcement purposes, the principle of dual
criminality should be applied. States should not use mutual legal assistance
processes and foreign requests for protected information to circumvent domestic
legal restrictions on communications surveillance. Mutual legal assistance
processes and other agreements should be clearly documented, publicly
available, and subject to guarantees of procedural fairness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Calibri'>Safeguards against
illegitimate access</span></b><span style='font-family:Calibri'>: States should
enact legislation criminalising illegal communications surveillance by public
or private actors. The law should provide sufficient and significant civil and
criminal penalties, protections for whistle blowers, and avenues for redress by
affected individuals. Laws should stipulate that any information obtained in a
manner that is inconsistent with these principles is inadmissible as evidence
in any proceeding, as is any evidence derivative of such information. </span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Calibri'>States should also enact laws providing
that, after material obtained through communications surveillance has been used
for the purpose for which information was given, the material must be destroyed
or returned to the individual.</span></p>
