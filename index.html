<h1>Draft International Principles on Surveillance and Human Rights</h1>

<h2>Preamble</h2>

<p>The principles were drafted at a meeting of civil society groups and industry in Brussels to address concerns relating to the expansion lawful access.</p>

<p>
Privacy is a fundamental human right, and is central to the maintenance of democratic societies. It is essential to human dignity and it reinforces other rights, such as freedom of expression and association, and is recognised under international human rights law.<a class="ptr">(1)</a> Activities that are contrary to the right to privacy, including the surveillance by public authorities of personal communications, can only be justified where they are necessary for a legitimate aim, strictly proportionate, and prescribed by law.<a class="ptr">(2)</a>  <a onclick="$('#more_preamble').show(1000); $('#more_preamble_link').hide(); return(false);" id="more_preamble_link" href="">(show more)</a>.

<div id="more_preamble">
<p>Before public adoption of the Internet, well-established legal principles and logistical burdens inherent in monitoring communications generally limited access to personal communications by public authorities. In recent decades, those logistical barriers to mass surveillance have decreased significantly. The explosion of digital communications content and the information about communications, or “communications metadata”, the falling cost of storing and mining large sets of data, and commitment of personal content to third party service providers make surveillance possible at an unprecedented scale.<a class="ptr">(3)</a></p>

<p>
While it is universally accepted that access to communications content must only occur in exceptional situations, the frequency with which public authorities are seeking access to information about an individual’s communications or use of electronic devices is rising dramatically—without adequate scrutiny.<a class="ptr">(4)</a> When accessed and analysed, communications metadata may create a profile of an individual’s private life, including medical conditions and political or religious viewpoints, disclosing even greater detail than would be discernible from the content of a communication alone.<a class="ptr">(5)</a> Despite this, legislative and policy instruments often afford communications metadata a lower level of protection.
</p>

<p>
It is therefore necessary that governments, international organisations, civil society and private service providers articulate baseline principles establishing the necessary level of protection for digital communications and communications metadata (collectively “information”) to match the goals articulated in international instruments on human rights—a democratic society governed by the rule of law. The purpose of these principles is to:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Provide guidance for legislative changes and advancements related to communications and communications metadata to ensure that pervasive use of modern communications technology does not result in a drastic erosion of everyone’s privacy.</li>
	<li>Establish appropriate safeguards to regulate access by public authorities (government agencies, departments, intelligence services or law enforcement agencies) to communications and communications metadata about an individual’s use of an electronic service or communication media. </li>
</ol>
<p>With these principles we seek only to establish the base level of protections that we expect in surveillance laws.  We call on governments to establish even stronger protections as required by their constitutions and human rights obligations, or as they recognize that technological changes or other factors require increased protection.</p>

<h2>The Principles</h2>

<p><strong>Legality</strong>: Any limitation to right to privacy must be prescribed by law. Neither the Executive nor the Judiciary may adopt or implement a measure that restricts the right to privacy without a previous act by the Legislature.</p>

<p><strong>Necessity</strong>: Laws allowing access to communications or communications metadata by authorised public authorities for the purposes of either law enforcement or intelligence should limit such access to that which is strictly and demonstrably necessary, in the sense that an overwhelmingly positive justification exists, and justifiable in a democratic society in order for the authority to pursue its legitimate activities, and which the authority would otherwise be unable to pursue. </p>

<p><strong>Adequacy</strong>:  Public authorities should restrain themselves from adopting or implementing any measure of intrusion allowing access to communications or communications metadata that is not appropriate for fulfillment of the legitimate purpose that justified establishing that measure.</p>

<p><strong>Proportionality</strong>: Public authorities should only order the preservation and access to specifically identified, targeted communications or communications metadata on a case-by-case basis, under a specified legal basis. Competent judicial authorities must determine the validity of each request, ensuring whether all formal requirements are fulfilled in each specific case. Communications and communications metadata are inherently sensitive and their acquisition should be regarded as highly intrusive. As such, requests should <strong>at a minimum</strong> establish a) that there is a very high degree of probability that a serious crime has been or will be committed; b) and that evidence of such a crime would be found by accessing the communications or communications metadata sought; c) traditional investigative techniques have been exhausted; and d) that a plan to ensure that the information collected will be only that information reasonably related to the crime and that any excess information collected will be promptly destroyed or returned. Neither the scope of information types, the number or type of persons whose information is sought, the amount of data sought, nor the level of secrecy afforded to the request should go beyond what is demonstrably necessary to achieve a specific investigation.  </p>

<p><strong>Due process</strong>: Due process requires that governments must uphold an individual’s fundamental rights, that any interference with such rights must be authorised in law, and that the lawful procedure that governs how the government can interfere with those rights is properly enumerated and available to the general public.<a class="ptr">(6)</a> While criminal investigations and other considerations of public security and safety may warrant limited access to information by public authorities, the granting of such access must be subject to guarantees of procedural fairness. Every request for access should be subject to prior authorisation by a competent judicial authority, except when there is imminent risk of danger to human life.<a class="ptr">(7)</a></p>

<p><strong>User notification</strong>: Notwithstanding the notification and transparency requirements that governments should bear, service providers should notify a user that a public authority has requested his or her communications or communications metadata with enough time and information about the request so that a user may challenge the request. In specific cases where the public authority wishes to delay the notification of the affected user or in an emergency situation where sufficient time may not be reasonable, the authority should be obliged to demonstrate that such notification would jeopardize the course of investigation to the competent judicial authority reviewing the request. In such cases, it is the responsibility of the public authority to notify the individual affected and the service provider as soon as the risk is lifted or after the conclusion of the investigation, whichever is sooner.</p>

<p><strong>Transparency about use of government surveillance</strong>:  The access capabilities of public authorities and the process for access should be prescribed by law and should be transparent to the public. The government and service providers should provide the maximum possible transparency about the access by public authorities without imperiling ongoing investigations, and with enough information so that individuals have sufficient knowledge to fully comprehend the scope and nature of the law, and when relevant, challenge it. Service providers must also publish the procedure they apply to deal with data requests from public authorities.</p>


<p><strong>Oversight</strong>:  An independent oversight mechanism should be established to ensure transparency of lawful access requests. This mechanism should have the authority to access information about public authorities' actions, including, where appropriate: access to secret or classified information, to assess whether public authorities are making legitimate use of their lawful capabilities, and to publish regular reports and data relevant to lawful access. This is addition to any oversight already provided through another branch of government such as parliament or a judicial authority. This mechanism must provide – at a minimum – aggregate information on the number of requests, the number of requests that were rejected, and a specification of the number of requests per service provider and per type of crime. <a class="ptr">(8)</a></p>


<p><strong>Integrity of communications and systems</strong>: 
 It is the responsibility of service providers to transmit and store communications and communications metadata securely and to a degree that is minimally necessary for operation. It is essential that the building blocks of our societies and economies incorporate security and privacy in the design phases. In order, in part, to ensure the integrity of the service providers’ systems, and in recognition of the fact that compromising security for government purposes almost always compromises security more generally, governments shall not compel service providers to build surveillance or monitoring capability into their systems.  Nor shall governments require that these systems be designed to collect or retain particular information purely for law enforcement or surveillance purposes. Such capabilities must be auditable. Moreover, <em>a priori</em> data retention or collection should never be required of service providers and orders for communications and communications metadata preservation must be decided on a case-by-case basis. </p>



<p><strong>Safeguards for international cooperation</strong>:  In response to changes in the flows of information and the technologies and services that are now used to communicate, governments may have to work across borders to fight crime. Mutual legal assistance treaties (MLATs) should ensure that, where the laws of more than one state could apply to communications and communications metadata, the higher/highest of the available standards should be applied to the data. Mutual legal assistance processes and how they are used should also be clearly documented and open to the public. The processes should distinguish between when law enforcement can collaborate for purposes of intelligence as opposed to sharing actual evidence. Moreover, governments cannot use international cooperation as a means to surveil people who it would otherwise be unlawful for them to surveil under their own laws, including their own citizens.  States must verify that the data collected or supplied, and the mode of analysis, in relation to its own citizens under MLAT is in fact limited to what is permitted. In the absence of an MLAT, service providers should not respond to requests of the government of a particular country requesting information of users if the requests do not include the same safeguards as providers would require from domestic authorities, and the safeguards do not match these principles.
</p>

<p><strong>Preventing illegitimate access</strong>: : To protect individuals against unwarranted attempts to access communications and communications metadata, governments should ensure those authorities and organisations who initiate or are complicit in unnecessary, disproportionate or extra-legal intercept or access are subject to sufficient and significant dissuasive penalties, including protection and rewards for whistleblowers, and that individuals affected by such activities are able to access avenues for redress. Any information obtained in a manner that is inconsistent with these principles is inadmissible as evidence in any proceeding, as is any evidence derivative of such information.  </p>

<p><strong>Cost of surveillance</strong>: The financial cost of providing access to user data should be borne by the public authority undertaking the investigation. Financial constraints place an institutional check on the overuse of orders, but the payments should not exceed the service provider’s actual costs for reviewing and responding to orders, as such would provide a perverse financial incentive in opposition to user’s rights. </p>

<li>Metadata may include information about our identities (subscriber information, device information), interests, including medical conditions, religion, political viewpoints (websites visited, books and other materials read, watched or listened to, searches conducted, resources used), interactions (origins and destinations of communications, people interacted with, friends, family, acquaintances), location (places and times, proximities to others); in sum, logs of nearly every action in modern life </li>
<li>For example, in the United Kingdom alone, there are now approximately 500,000 requests for communications metadata every year, currently under a self-authorising regime for law enforcement agencies, who are able to authorise their own requests for access to information held by service providers.  Meanwhile, data provided by Google’s Transparency reports shows that requests for user data from the U.S. alone rose from 8888 in 2010 to 12,271 in 2011.  </li>
<li>See as examples, a review of Sandy Petland’s work, ‘Reality Mining’, in MIT’s Technology Review, 2008, available at <a href="http://www2.technologyreview.com/article/409598/tr10-reality-mining/">http://www2.technologyreview.com/article/409598/tr10-reality-mining/</a> and also see Alberto Escudero-Pascual and Gus Hosein, ‘Questioning lawful access to traffic data’, Communications of the ACM, Volume 47 Issue 3, March 2004, pages 77 - 82.  </li>
<li>As defined by international and regional conventions mentioned above.  </li>
<li>Where judicial review is waived in such emergency cases, a warrant must be retroactively sought within 24 hours.  </li>
<li>One example of such a report is the US Wiretap report, published by the US Court service.  Unfortunately this applies only to interception of communications, and not to access to communications metadata.  See <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/Statistics/WiretapReports/WiretapReport2011.aspx">http://www.uscourts.gov/Statistics/WiretapReports/WiretapReport2011.aspx</a>.  The UK Interception of Communications Commissioner publishes a report that includes some aggregate data but it is does not provide sufficient data to scrutinise the types of requests, the extent of each access request, the purpose of the requests, and the scrutiny applied to them.
