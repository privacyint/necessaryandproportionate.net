<h1>The Brussels Principles on Lawful Access</h1>

<h2>Preamble</h2>

<p>Privacy is a fundamental human right, and is central to the maintenance of liberal and democratic societies. It is essential to human dignity and it reinforces other rights, such as freedom of expression and association, and is recognised as a fundamental human right under international human rights law<a class="ptr">(1)</a>.  Activities that are contrary to the right to privacy, including the surveillance by public authorities of personal communications, can only be justified where they are prescribed by law, necessary for a legitimate aim, and strictly proportionate<a class="ptr">(2)</a>  <a onclick="$('#more_preamble').show(1000); $('#more_preamble_link').hide(); return(false);" id="more_preamble_link" href="">(show more)</a>.

<div id="more_preamble">
<p>Before public adoption of the Internet, well-established legal principles and logistical burdens inherent in monitoring communications generally limited access to personal communications by public authorities. In recent decades, those logistical barriers to mass surveillance have decreased significantly. The explosion of digital communications content and the information about communications, or "communications metadata", the falling cost of storing and mining large sets of data, and commitment of personal content to third party service providers make surveillance possible at an unprecedented scale<a class="ptr">(3)</a>. </p>

<p>While it is universally accepted that access to communications content must only occur in exceptional situations, the frequency with which public authorities are seeking access to information about an individual's communications or use of electronic devices is rising dramaticallyâ€”without adequate scrutiny. When accessed and analysed, communications metadata may create a profile of an individual's private life, including medical conditions and political or religious viewpoints, disclosing even greater detail than would be discernible from the content of a communication alone. Despite this, legislative and policy instruments often afford communications metadata a lower level of protection.

<p>It is therefore necessary that governments, international organisations, civil society and private service providers articulate baseline principles establishing the necessary level of protection for digital communications and communications metadata to match the goals articulated in those international instruments &mdash; a democratic society governed by the rule of law. The purpose of these principles is to:
<ul>
<li>Provide guidance for legislative changes and advancements related to communications and communications metadata to ensure that pervasive use of modern communications technology does not result in a drastic erosion of everyone's privacy.</li>
<li>Establish appropriate safeguards to regulate real-time and historical access by public authorities (government agencies, departments, intelligence services or law enforcement agencies) to communications and metadata (collectively "information") about an individual's use of an electronic service or communication media. </li>
</ul>


<h2>The Principles</h2>

<p><strong>Necessity</strong>: Laws allowing access to communications or communications metadata by authorised public authorities for the purposes of either law enforcement or intelligence should limit such access to that which is strictly and demonstrably necessary, in the sense that an overwhelmingly positive justification exists, and justifiable in a democratic society in order for the authority to pursue its legitimate activities, and which the authority would otherwise be unable to pursue. </p>

<p><strong>Proportionality</strong>: Public authorities should only order the retention and access to specifically identified, targeted communications or communications metadata on a case-by-case basis. Competent judicial authorities must determine the validity of each request from a government agency. Requests should <strong>at a minimum</strong> establish a) that there is reasonable suspicion that a crime has been or will be committed, b) that evidence of such a crime probably would be found by accessing communications or communications metadata, and c) a plan to ensure that the information collected will be only that information reasonably related to the crime. Neither the scope of information types, the number or type of persons whose information is sought, nor the level of secrecy afforded to the request should go beyond what is demonstrably necessary to achieve an investigation.</p>

<p><strong>Due process</strong>: Due process requires that governments must uphold an individual's fundamental rights, that any interference with such rights must be authorised in law, and that the lawful procedure that governs how the government can interfere with those rights is properly enumerated<a class="ptr">(4)</a>.  While criminal investigations and other considerations of public security and safety may warrant limited access to communications by public authorities, the granting of such access must be subject to guarantees of procedural fairness. Every request for access should be subject to prior authorisation by a competent judicial authority, except when there is imminent risk of danger to human life<a class="ptr">(5)</a>. </p>

<p><strong>User notification</strong>: Notwithstanding the notification and transparency requirements that governments should bear, service providers should notify a user that a public authority has requested his or her data with enough time and information about the request so that a user may challenge the request. In specific cases where the public authority wishes to prevent the notification of the affected user or in an emergency situation where sufficient time may not be reasonable, the authority should be obliged to demonstrate that such notification would jeopardize the course of investigation to the competent judicial authority reviewing the request. In such cases, it is the responsibility of the public authority to notify the individual affected as soon as the risk is lifted or after the conclusion of the investigation, whichever is sooner.</p>

<p><strong>Transparency about use of government surveillance</strong>: The access capabilities of public authorities and the process for access should be prescribed by law and should be transparent to the public. The government should provide the maximum possible transparency about the access by public authorities without imperiling ongoing investigations, and with enough information so that citizens have sufficient knowledge to fully comprehend the scope and nature of the law.</p>

<p><strong>Oversight</strong>: An independent oversight mechanism should be established to ensure transparency of lawful access requests. This mechanism should have the authority to access information about public authorities' actions, including, where appropriate: access to secret or classified information, to assess whether public authorities are making legitimate use of their lawful capabilities, and to publish regular reports and data relevant to lawful access. This is addition to any oversight already provided through another branch of government such as Parliament, a Congressional committee or a judicial authority.</p>

<p><strong>Integrity of communications and systems</strong>: It is the responsibility of service providers to transmit and store user data securely and to a degree that is minimally necessary for operation. It is essential that the building blocks of our societies and economies incorporate security and privacy in the design phases. In order, in part, to ensure the integrity of the service providers' systems, and in recognition of the fact that compromising security for government purposes almost always compromises security more generally, governments shall not compel service providers to build surveillance or monitoring capability into their systems.  Nor shall governments require that these systems be designed to collect or retain particular information purely for law enforcement or surveillance purposes. Such capabilities must be auditable. Moreover, a priori data retention or collection should never be required of service providers and orders for data preservation must be decided on a case-by-case basis. </p>

<p><strong>Safeguards for international cooperation</strong>: In response to changes in technology, new services and evolving usage patterns, governments must often work across borders to fight crime. Mutual legal assistance arrangements should ensure that, where the laws of more than one state could apply to communications data, the higher/highest of the available standards should be applied to the data. Mutual legal assistance processes and how they are used should also be clearly documented and open to the public. The processes should distinguish between when law enforcement can collaborate for purposes of intelligence as opposed to sharing actual evidence. Moreover, governments cannot use international cooperation as a means to surveil people who it would otherwise be unlawful for them to surveil under their own laws, including their own citizens.  States must verify that the data collected or supplied, and the mode of analysis, in relation to its own citizens under MLAT is in fact limited to what is permitted.</p>

<p><strong>Preventing illegitimate access</strong>: To protect individuals against unwarranted attempts to access information, governments should ensure those who initiate or are complicit in unnecessary, disproportionate or extra-legal intercept or access are subject to sufficient and significant dissuasive penalties, including protection and rewards for whistleblowers, and that individuals affected by such activities are able to access avenues for redress. Any information obtained in a manner that is inconsistent with these principles is inadmissible as evidence in any proceeding, as is any evidence derivative of such information.</p>

<p><strong>Cost of surveillance</strong>: The financial cost of providing access to user data should be borne by the public authority undertaking the investigation. Financial constraints place an institutional check on the overuse of orders, but the payments should not exceed the service provider's actual costs for reviewing and responding to orders, as such would provide a perverse financial incentive in opposition to user's rights. </p>
