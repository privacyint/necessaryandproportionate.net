<h1>
	International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance
</h1>

<p><b>Final version June 7 2013</b></p>

<p>As technologies that
facilitate State surveillance of communications advance, States are failing to
ensure that laws and regulations related to communications surveillance adhere
to international human rights and adequately protect the rights to privacy and
freedom of expression. This document attempts to explain how international human
rights law applies in the current digital environment, particularly in light of
the increase in and changes to communications surveillance technologies and
techniques. These principles can provide civil society groups, industry, and States
with a framework to evaluate whether current or proposed surveillance laws and
practices are consistent with human rights. </p>

<p>These principles are the
outcome of a global consultation with civil society groups, industry and
international experts in communications surveillance law, policy and technology.</p>

<p><b>Preamble</b></p>

<p>Privacy is a fundamental
human right, and is central to the maintenance of democratic societies. It is
essential to human dignity and it reinforces other rights, such as freedom of
expression and information, and freedom of association, and is recognised under
international human rights law.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> Activities
that restrict the right to privacy, including communications surveillance, can
only be justified when they are prescribed by law, they are necessary to
achieve a legitimate aim, and are proportionate to the aim pursued.<a
href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a></p>

<p>Before public adoption of
the Internet, well-established legal principles and logistical burdens inherent
in monitoring communications created limits to State communications
surveillance. In recent decades, those logistical barriers to surveillance have
decreased and the application of legal principles in new technological contexts
has become unclear. The explosion of digital communications content and
information about communications, or "communications metadata," the falling
cost of storing and mining large sets of data, and the provision of personal
content through third party service providers make State surveillance possible
at an unprecedented scale.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a> Meanwhile,
conceptualisations of existing human rights law have not kept up with the
modern and changing communications surveillance capabilities of the State, the
ability of the State to combine and organize information gained from different
surveillance techniques, or the increased sensitivity of the information
available to be accessed.</p>

<p>The frequency
with which States are seeking access to communications content and communications metadata -- information
about an individual's communications or use of electronic devices -- is rising
dramatically, without adequate scrutiny.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4"
title="">[4]</a> When
accessed and analysed, communications metadata may create a profile of an
individual's private life, including medical conditions, political and
religious viewpoints, interactions and interests, disclosing as much detail as,
or even greater detail than would be discernible from the content of
communications alone.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a> Despite
the vast potential for intrusion into an individual's private life, legislative
and policy instruments often afford communications metadata a lower level of
protection and do not place sufficient restrictions on how they can be
subsequently used by agencies, including how they are data-mined, shared, and
retained.</p>

<p>In order for States to
actually meet their international human rights obligations in relation to
communications surveillance, they must comply with the principles set out
below. These principles apply not only to the State's obligation to respect and
fulfil individuals' rights, but also to the obligation to protect individuals'
rights from abuse by non-State actors, including corporate entities.<a
href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a> The private sector bears equal
responsibility for respecting and protecting human rights, particularly given
the key role it plays in designing, developing and disseminating technologies;
enabling and providing communications; and &#8211; where required &#8211;
cooperating with State surveillance activities. Nevertheless, the scope of the
present Principles is limited to the obligations of the State. </p>

<p><b>Changing technology and definitions</b></p>

<p>"Communications
surveillance" in the modern environment encompasses the monitoring,
interception, collection, preservation and retention of, interference with, or
access to information that
includes, reflects, arises from or is about a person's communications in the
past, present or future. "Communications" include activities, interactions and
transactions transmitted through electronic mediums, such as content of
communications, the identity of the parties to the communications,
location-tracking information such as IP addresses, the time and duration of
communications, and identifiers of communication equipment used in
communications.</p>

<p>Traditionally,
the invasiveness of communications surveillance has been evaluated on the basis of artificial and
formalistic categories. Existing legal frameworks distinguish between "content" or "non-content," "subscriber
information" or "metadata," stored data or in transit data, data held in the
home or in the possession of a third party service provider.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7"
title="">[7]</a>
However, these distinctions are no longer appropriate for
measuring the degree of the intrusion that communications surveillance makes
into individuals' private lives. While it has long been agreed that
communications content deserves significant protection in law because of its
capability to reveal sensitive information, it is now clear that other
information arising from communications &#8211; metadata and other forms of
non-content data &#8211; may reveal even more about an individual than the
content itself, and thus deserves equivalent protection. Today, each of these types of
information might, taken alone or analysed collectively, reveal a person's identity,
behaviour, associations, physical or medical conditions<b>, </b>race, colour, sexual orientation,
national origins, or viewpoints;
or enable the mapping of the person's location, movements or interactions over
time,<a href="#_edn8"
name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a> or of all people in a given location,
including around a public demonstration or other political event. As a result, all information
that includes, reflects, arises from or is about a person's communications and
that is not readily available and easily accessible to the general public,
should be considered to be "protected information", and should accordingly be
given the highest protection in law.</p>

<p>In evaluating
the invasiveness of State communications surveillance, it is necessary to
consider both the potential of the surveillance to reveal protected
information, as well as the purpose for which the information is sought by the
State. Communications surveillance that will likely lead to the revelation of
protected information that may place a person at risk of investigation,
discrimination or violation of human rights will constitute a serious
infringement on an individual's right to privacy, and will also undermine the enjoyment of other fundamental
rights, including the right to free expression, association, and political
participation. This is because these rights require people to be able to
communicate free from the chilling effect of government surveillance. A determination
of both the character and potential uses of the information sought will thus be
necessary in each specific case.</p>

<p>When adopting a
new communications surveillance technique or expanding the scope of an existing
technique, the State should ascertain whether the information likely to be
procured falls within the ambit of "protected information" before seeking it,
and should submit to the scrutiny of the judiciary or other democratic
oversight mechanism. In considering
whether information obtained through communications surveillance rises to the
level of "protected information", the form as well as the scope and duration of
the surveillance are relevant factors. Because pervasive or systematic monitoring has the
capacity to reveal private information far in excess of its constituent parts,
it can elevate surveillance of non-protected information to a level of
invasiveness that demands strong protection.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9"
title="">[9]</a></p>

<p>The determination of
whether the State may conduct communications surveillance that interferes with
protected information must be consistent with the following principles.</p>

<p><b><u>>The Principles</u></b></p>

<p><b>Legality:</b> Any limitation to the right to privacy must be
prescribed by law. The State must not adopt or implement a measure that
interferes with the right to privacy in the absence of an existing publicly
available legislative act, which meets a standard of clarity and precision that
is sufficient to ensure that individuals have advance notice of and can foresee
its application. Given the rate of technological changes, laws that limit the
right to privacy should be subject to periodic review by means of a
participatory legislative or regulatory process. </p>

<p><b>Legitimate Aim:</b> Laws
should only permit communications surveillance by specified State authorities
to achieve a legitimate aim that corresponds to a predominantly important
legal interest that is necessary in a democratic society. Any measure must not be applied in a
manner which discriminates on the basis of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or
other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.</p>

<p<b>Necessity:</b> Laws permitting communications
surveillance by the State must limit surveillance to that which is strictly and
demonstrably necessary to achieve a legitimate aim. Communications surveillance
must only be conducted when it is the only means of achieving a legitimate aim,
or, when there are multiple means, it is the means least likely to infringe
upon human rights. The onus of establishing this justification, in judicial as
well as in legislative processes, is on the State.</p>

<p><b>Adequacy:</b> Any instance of communications surveillance
authorised by law must be appropriate to fulfil the specific legitimate aim
identified.</p>

<p>Proportionality:</b> Communications surveillance should be
regarded as a highly intrusive act that interferes with the rights to privacy
and freedom of opinion and expression, threatening the foundations of a
democratic society. Decisions about communications surveillance must be made by
weighing the benefit sought to be achieved against the harm that would be
caused to the individual's rights and to other competing interests, and should
involve a consideration of the sensitivity of the information and the severity
of the infringement on the right to privacy.</p>

<p>Specifically, this
requires that, if a State seeks access to protected information through
communications surveillance in the context of a criminal investigation, it must
establish to the competent, independent, and impartial judicial authority that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>there is a high degree of probability that a serious crime has been or will be committed; </li>
<li>
evidence of such a
crime would be obtained by accessing the protected information sought;</li>
<li>other available less
invasive investigative techniques have been exhausted; </li>
<li>information accessed
will be confined to that reasonably relevant to the crime alleged and any
excess information collected will be promptly destroyed or returned; and</li>
<li>information is accessed only by the
specified authority and used for the purpose for which authorisation was
given.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the State
seeks access to protected information through communication surveillance for a
purpose that will not place a person at risk of criminal prosecution,
investigation, discrimination or infringement of human rights, the State must
establish to an independent, impartial, and competent authority:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>other available less
invasive investigative techniques have been considered; </li>
<li>
information accessed
will be confined to what is reasonably relevant and any excess information
collected will be promptly destroyed or returned to the impacted individual;
and</li>
<li>information is
accessed only by the specified authority and used for the purpose for which was
authorisation was given.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Competent Judicial Authority:</b> Determinations
related to communications surveillance must be made by a competent judicial
authority that is impartial and independent.&nbsp; The authority must
be (1) separate from the authorities conducting communications surveillance,
(2) conversant in issues related to and competent to make judicial decisions
about communications technologies and human rights, and (3) have adequate
resources in exercising the functions assigned to them.</p>

<p><b>Due process:</b> Due process requires that States respect and
guarantee individuals' human rights by ensuring that lawful procedures that
govern any interference with human rights are properly enumerated in law,
consistently practiced, and available to the general public. <span
>Specifically, in
the determination on his or
her human rights, everyone
is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an
independent, competent and impartial tribunal established by law<span
>,<a href="#_edn10"
name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a><span
> except in cases of emergency when there is
imminent risk of danger to human life. In such instances, retroactive
authorisation must be sought within a reasonably practicable time period. Mere
risk of flight or destruction of evidence shall never be considered as
sufficient to justify retroactive authorisation.&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>User notification</b><span
>: Individuals should be notified of a decision
authorising communications surveillance with enough time and information to
enable them to appeal the decision, and should have access to the materials
presented in support of the application for authorisation. Delay in
notification is only justified in the following circumstances:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Notification would seriously
jeopardize the purpose for which the surveillance is authorised, or there is an
imminent risk of danger to human life; or</li>
<li>Authorisation to delay
notification is granted by the competent judicial authority at the time that
authorisation for surveillance is granted; and</li>
<li>The individual affected is
notified as soon as the risk is lifted or within a reasonably practicable time
period, whichever is sooner, and in any event by the time the communications
surveillance has been completed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Upon the expiry of the
delay, communications service providers shall be free to notify individuals of
the communications surveillance, voluntarily or upon request.</p>

<p><b>Transparency: </b><span
>States should be transparent about the use and scope
of communications surveillance techniques and powers. They should publish, at a
minimum, aggregate information on the number of requests approved and rejected,
a disaggregation of the requests by service provider and by investigation and
purpose. States should provide individuals with sufficient information to
enable them to fully comprehend the scope, nature and application of the laws
permitting communications surveillance. States should enable service providers
to publish the procedures they apply when dealing with State communications
surveillance, adhere to those procedures, and publish records of State
communications surveillance. </p>

<p><b>Public oversight:</b> States should establish independent oversight
mechanisms to ensure transparency and accountability of communications
surveillance.<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a>&nbsp;Oversight
mechanisms should have the authority to access information about State actions,
including, where appropriate, access to secret or classified information; to
assess whether the State is making legitimate use of its lawful capabilities;
to evaluate whether the State has been transparently and accurately publishing
information about the use and scope of communications surveillance techniques
and powers; and to publish periodic reports and other information relevant to
communications surveillance. Independent oversight mechanisms should be
established in addition to any oversight already provided through another
branch of government. </p>

<p><b>Integrity of
communications and systems</b>: In
order to ensure the integrity, security and privacy of communications systems,
and in recognition of the fact that compromising security for State purposes
almost always compromises security more generally, States should not compel
service providers or
hardware or software vendors to build
surveillance or monitoring capability into their systems, or to collect or
retain particular information purely for State surveillance purposes. <i>A<span>
priori</i>&nbsp;data retention or collection should never be required of
service providers. Individuals have the right to express themselves
anonymously; States should therefore refrain from compelling the identification
of users as a precondition for service provision.<a href="#_edn12"
name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a></p>

<p><b>Safeguards for
international cooperation:</b>: In
response to changes in the flows of information, and in communications technologies
and services, States may need to seek assistance from a foreign service
provider. Accordingly, the mutual legal assistance treaties (MLATs) and other
agreements entered into by States should ensure that, where the laws of more
than one state could apply to communications surveillance, the available
standard with the higher level of protection for individuals is applied. Where
States seek assistance for law enforcement purposes, the principle of dual
criminality should be applied. States should not use mutual legal assistance
processes and foreign requests for protected information to circumvent domestic
legal restrictions on communications surveillance. Mutual legal assistance
processes and other agreements should be clearly documented, publicly
available, and subject to guarantees of procedural fairness.</p>

<p><b>Safeguards against
illegitimate access:</b> States should
enact legislation criminalising illegal communications surveillance by public
or private actors. The law should provide sufficient and significant civil and
criminal penalties, protections for whistle blowers, and avenues for redress by
affected individuals. Laws should stipulate that any information obtained in a
manner that is inconsistent with these principles is inadmissible as evidence
in any proceeding, as is any evidence derivative of such information. <span
>States should also enact laws providing
that, after material obtained through communications surveillance has been used
for the purpose for which information was given, the material must be destroyed
or returned to the individual.</p>
